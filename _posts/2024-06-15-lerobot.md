## Overview 

This project began as research project for automated the recycle process in warehouse. Hugging Face's LeRobot project is an open source project on machine learning models for real-world robotics, especially within domains like imitation and reinforcement learning. It is a wrapper on top of Stanford paper ALOHA. Stanford ALOHA refers to a series of robotics systems, with the primary goal of creating low-cost, open-source hardware for robotics research. ALOHA initially started as a bimanual teleoperation system but has since evolved into Mobile ALOHA, which combines mobility with advanced whole-body manipulation capabilities. Mobile ALOHA is designed to perform complex real-world tasks like cooking, cleaning, and navigating environments, making it useful for research in areas such as imitation learning and human-robot interaction.

The deliverable from this project is to pick and place recycled phones.
