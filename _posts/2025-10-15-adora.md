## Overview 

The ADORA Robot represents a family of mobile robots that use the open-source Dora-rs software. As an intern, since 2024 I worked on mechanical design and development for three variants: ADORA MAX, ADORA Pro, and ADORA Nano.

## GoSIM Hackathon 

These robots were used in both GoSIM 2024 (Beijing) and GoSIM 2025 (Hangzhou) hackathons. The GOSIM 2025(Global Open-Source Innovation Meetup) conference in Hangzhou was held from September 13â€“14, 2025. I am proud to be part of the design and development of these robots that served as the competition platform for these prestigious events.

For the GoSIM 2024 hackathon in Beijing, I designed the mechanical parts for the Realman robot arm to mount on the 4-wheel base, creating the ADORA Pro platform.

## ADORA nano

ADORA Nano is a mobile robot built on the Hugging Face LeRobot arm platform. I independently designed and developed it to serve as a core platform for the GoSIM Hackathon.

## ADORA Pro

ADORA Pro has been used by several universities in the World Humanoid Robot Games. I worked on the mechanical design of ADORA Pro, including custom CAD components.

## Results

The ADORA series successfully supported the GoSIM hackathon's competitive challenges, demonstrating the effectiveness of the functional design approach across all three variants.
